# WootingCursor
Mouse control service designed for wooting hall effect keyboards. Also supports analog mouse scrolling. 

Currently, bindings are hard-coded. Here are the keys: 

* F13 -> Mouse movement left
* F14 -> Mouse movement down
* F15 -> Mouse movement right
* F16 -> Mouse movement up
* F17 -> Scroll up
* F18 -> Scroll dowen

All of these controls make use of the wooting analog sdk
